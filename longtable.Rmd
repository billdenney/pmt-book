# Tables that span multiple pages: longtable

## Syntax

To create a long table from a data frame

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stable_long(stdata())
```

To create a long table from pipeline

```{r, eval = FALSE}
st_new(data) %>% stable_long()
```

To create a long table from `pmtable`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pt_cont_long(data, cols = "WT,EGFR") %>% stable_long()
```


## Basics

You can create `longtables` that span multiple pages of your pdf document.
Tables using the`longtable` environment are very different than the the 
basic table from `stable()` which are built using tabular environment.


## Inserting longtable into your latex document

Once you have written your long table out to a file, you can source it into 
your latex document with a simple input command

```{txt, eval = FALSE}
\input{my-table.tex}
```

You should not wrap your longtable input code in `\begin{table}`/`\end{table}`
as you would with a regular tabular table.
