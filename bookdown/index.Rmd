# About this book

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.
