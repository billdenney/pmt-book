I hope this will be useful for \nthose who are new to the package and those who just need a  reminder on the \nsyntax. \n\n\npmtables turns R data frames into tables for inclusion in a TeX document. Since\nthe current book is rendered to `html` format, we cannot naturally render the \ntable outputs as we work examples. Instead, we process the output table code\nin a `pdf` snippet and include it into the `html` document as a `png` file. \nThis is accomplished using a new function called `st_as_image()`. The only \npurpose for calling this function is to get the table to appear in the pages\nof this book. This function can be useful for previewing tables or having them\nappear in `html` documents but it should generally not be used if creating\noutputs for TeX reports. You will not find this function in a pmtables release \nyet; but it will be available for the release after `0.4.1`. \n\nThere is also a `pdf` version of this book available \n[here](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/pmt-book/blob/master/pmt-intro.pdf). \n\n# Build {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npackageVersion(\"pmtables\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] '0.4.1.9003'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndate()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Sun May  1 20:43:28 2022\"\n```\n:::\n:::",
